# Solace  Engineering Assignment

# **üéâ Congratulations!**

You are here because we think you could be a good fit to join our team here at¬†Solace!

‚Äç

We're looking for someone who can both work within a team but also independently break down large tasks into manageable pieces, implement beautiful UI with precision, and know when to ask for help. We hope you're the person we're searching for! üöÄ

# **About the assignment**

Below, you'll find an exercise we've chosen to represent the work you may encounter in this role. There is no single right answer ‚Äî we've left it intentionally open-ended to understand how you think.¬†Our goals with this challenge are to:

- Learn as much as we can about how you think about code, improve existing code, and add features to a new code base.
- Require as little of your time as possible. By limiting this to 2 hours, we hope this is manageable with your busy schedule.
- Demonstrate your ability in our stack.

<aside>
‚è≤Ô∏è We recommend spending no more than¬†**2 hours**¬†working on this. If you find yourself going over this time limit, feel free to simply share what you would have done with extra time in `DISCUSSION.md`.

# **Background**

At Solace, we aim to match patients with the advocate who is best suited to their needs. To support this goal, we have a table of all of our advocates with some information about them that the patient can search on to find the best match. For this assignment, we have an initial version of this table built in a NextJS application, however it was built by an AI chimpanzee who hadn‚Äôt had his latest update yet so it‚Äôs full of bugs, bad patterns, and performance pitfalls.

# The Assignment

Download the repo: 

[solace-candidate-assignment.zip](attachment:9975938a-5be0-4127-84dc-c45b5f6b2d05:solace-candidate-assignment.zip)

You should **open up one (or several) PRs against the main branch of your repo** with your bug fixes and improvements. Organize the PRs however you like, but be sure to include in the PR description why you made the change and why it‚Äôs an improvement on the previous code/implementation.

The app is configured to return a default list of advocates. The README has instructions on configuring the database and seeding it with advocates.

<aside>
‚ö†Ô∏è Please make all API calls to the NextJS backend and avoid Next server actions. We want to test your knowledge of both frontend and backend so assume that the API server is a separate application. We‚Äôve kept this a full stack NextJS app for convenience.

</aside>

## Tasks

1. Fix any glaring bugs and anti patterns.
2. Improve the design UI/UX to make the experience better for prospective patients. We value design heavily at Solace so feel free to flex your skills in this area. The repo is set up with tailwind but feel free to use any styling framework you‚Äôd like.
3. Consider both frontend and backend performance improvements. Assume we have a database of hundreds of thousands of advocates we need to search through.

‚Äç

Feel free to be creative if you see any other improvements you think are worth spending time on!

# Deliverables

1. Submit the assignment with a link to the cloned repo with the PRs of your changes on the previous page in the **notes** section. If private, please add [**alyant**](https://github.com/alyant), [**mwrather**](https://github.com/mwrather), and [**ericcallan**](https://github.com/ericcallan) to the GitHub project for the Senior Full Stack position. 
2. Add whatever extra notes you want to `DISCUSSION.md` explaining any other improvements you‚Äôd want to make if you had more time.  Note that we aren't evaluating you on your familiarity with Markdown but feel free to add formatting if you wish.
